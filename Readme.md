# International Basketball Player Translation

## Overview
An analytics staff needs to provide some recommendations of players currently playing outside of the NBA for the GM to target. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop a framework which is capable of predicting playersâ€™ performance in the NBA on the basis of their performance in the 4 main European leagues, including EuroLeague, EuroCup, Spain's Liga ACB and Italy's Liga A. This project is composed of four parts as follows:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model building (multiple linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost) and parameter tuning (cross validation and grid search)
3. Model evaluation (MSE and boxplot)
4. Rank aggregation (cross-entropy Monte Carlo algorithm)
